Transport classes and utilities shared among Python Elastic client libraries

This library was lifted from [`elasticsearch-py`](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-py)
and then transformed to be used across all Elastic services
rather than only Elasticsearch.

### Installing from PyPI

```
$ python -m pip install elastic-transport
```

Versioning follows the major and minor version of the Elastic Stack version and
the patch number is incremented for bug fixes within a minor release.                      |
